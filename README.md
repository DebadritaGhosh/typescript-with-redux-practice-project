# React + Redux TypeScript Practice Project

This is a practice project for implementing React with Redux and TypeScript. The project utilizes the npm API to search for packages based on user input. It features a simple interface with a textbox for entering search queries and a button to trigger the search. The search results are fetched using Axios and stored in the Redux store using Redux Thunk for asynchronous actions.

   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server
